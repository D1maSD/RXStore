# RXStore
Test task from company where i work to improve my skills before i go on new project with MVVM architecture and reactive components. I recieve a simple description of this app. Main idea of this app is the presence of a filter to select clothes. Simple product page with RxSwift and Firestore
- You can see a detail description of clothes.
- Select color of clothes.
- Filter available. You can choose the type of clothes you want to buy.
- Data and metrics about clothes takes from remote firebase server.
